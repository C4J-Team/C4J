C4J 4.0 Beta5 (05/17/2012)
=====
New Features:
* Configuration.getExternalContractsAsStrings() - external contracts can also be configured using strings
* introduced Condition.noneIdentifiedYet() to communicate that no pre- or post-condition has been identified yet
* advanced old() and unchanged() working with arbitrary expressions without local variables
* PreTransformer allows to search a directory recursively, transform the contained .class files and save them to disk
* Configuration.getContractsDirectory() now also accepts JAR-files
* added EPL 1.0 as the license for C4J 4.0+

Fixes:
* renamed pre() and post() to preCondition() and postCondition() in order to be more descriptive
* solved class-loader issues when using @Contract
* @Pure strict enforcement now also works with array-element reassignments
