=====
New Features:
* new version system, indicating compatibility to Java 6 and to allow having a separate version for Java 8
* LSP fully implemented, now being sensitive that pre-conditions from multiple inherited interfaces must not be different

Fixes:
* fixed constructor-usage within old()
* local configuration for top-level packages is found
* performance improvement by avoiding calls to Thread.getStackTrace()
* pure validation within class initializers allows write-access on own static fields
* @Pure inheritance from pure registry

C4J 4.0-Beta7 (08/15/2012)

* changed configuration to be xml-based using a local and a global configuration

Fixes:
* @AllowPureAccess is now usable with Objects
* fixed various issues executing conditions in the correct order
* old-expressions are no longer being evaluated in the post-condition
* fixed various side-effect issues using old and unchanged in post-conditions and invariants
* fixed pure mechanism trying to access package-private fields from super-classes when class is not in the same package

C4J 4.0-Beta6 (06/14/2012)
=====
New Features:
* changed package-name to de.vksi.c4j
* contracts for static methods, including static initializers
* old() and unchanged() now usable within class-invariants
* UsageError when referencing an overridden contract method from another contract method
* UsageError when using @Pure on a contract method, which is already implicitly pure
* migrated from Ant to Maven
* setup a build server with BuildHive

Fixes:
* once a condition fails, no other conditions will be checked
* class-invariants are no longer considered for private methods
* removed false warning when using a constructor in a contract class
* removed deprecated Condition.pre() and Condition.post()


C4J 4.0-Beta5 (05/17/2012)
=====
New Features:
* Configuration.getExternalContractsAsStrings() - external contracts can also be configured using strings
* introduced Condition.noneIdentifiedYet() to communicate that no pre- or post-condition has been identified yet
* advanced old() and unchanged() working with arbitrary expressions without local variables
* PreTransformer allows to search a directory recursively, transform the contained .class files and save them to disk
* Configuration.getContractsDirectory() now also accepts JAR-files
* added EPL 1.0 as the license for C4J 4.0+

Fixes:
* renamed pre() and post() to preCondition() and postCondition() in order to be more descriptive
* solved class-loader issues when using @Contract
* @Pure strict enforcement now also works with array-element reassignments
