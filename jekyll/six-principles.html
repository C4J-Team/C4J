Richard Mitchell and Jim McKim state six elementary principles how to write good contracts:
</p>
<br/>
<P>
Principle 1: <I>Separate queries from commands.</I>
<BR>
Queries return a result but do not change the visible properties of the object.
Commands might change the object but do not return a result.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
Principle 2: <I>Separate basic queries from derived queries.</I>
<BR>
Derived queries can be specified in terms of basic queries.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
Principle 3: <I>For each derived query, write a postcondition that specifies what result will be returned, in terms of one or more basic queries.</I>
<BR>
Then, if we know the values of the basic queries, we also know the values of the derived queries.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
Principle 4: <I>For each command, write a postcondition that specifies the value of every basic query.</I>
<BR>
Now we know the total visible effect of each command.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
Principle 5: <I>For every query and command, decide on a suitable precondition.</I>
<BR>
Preconditions constrain when clients may call the queries and commands.
</P>
<BR>
<P>
Principle 6: <I>Write invariants to define unchanging properties of objects.</I>
<BR>
Concentrate on properties that help the reader build an appropriate conceptual model of the abstraction the class embodies.
</P>
<BR>
<p>
These six principles have been applied to all the examples on this website and the tutorials and case studies.
