C4J uses the
<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(computing)" 
target=_blank>assert mechanism</A>
of Java and extends it to interfaces and inheritance
by separating the assertions in separate contract classes.
<BR>
As contract classes are plain Java classes,
software engineers have the <I>full power of Java to express even complicated assertions.</I>
<BR>
Furthermore contract classes are <I>stateful</I>,
as each instance of a protected class has its own instance of its protecting contract class.
<BR>
Based on that simple and powerful concept C4J supports:
</p>
<ul>
<LI>Class invariants. 
<LI>Preconditions.
<LI>Postconditions, with access to return- and old-values. 
<LI>Access to the public members of the guarded class from the contract implementation. 
<LI>Annotations like @Pure to explicitly mark methods as "pure" (even methods defined in interfaces). 
<LI>Automatic validation of pure methods, i.e. automatic checking that as pure annotated methods really do not have any side effects.
<LI>Access to the "old" values of target attributes in postconditions.
<LI>Simple to use "unchanged" check in postconditions to ensure that a target attribute has not been changed by the method execution.
<LI>Contracts for interfaces, i.e. define a contract for an interface and all implementing classes (and their sub classes) will verify the contract. <LI>Inheritance of contracts, i.e. extending classes or implementing interfaces inherits the parent's contracts, also for overridden methods. 
<LI>Contracts for abstract methods, i.e. define a contract for an abstract method in an abstract class
and all implementing classes (and their subclasses) will verify the contract.
<LI>External contracts allowing to attach contracts to legacy code.
<LI>Combinations of "internal" and "external" contracts in the same project.
<LI>Combinations of "interface contracts" and "class contracts", works like contract refinement. 
<LI>Contract refinement, i.e. extending classes may define their own contracts
in which case they are merged with the parent contracts
according to the
<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle" 
target=_blank>Liskov substitution principle</A>. 
<LI>Logging of contract validations.
<LI>Ability to configure which contracts should be activated and which not.
<LI>Ability to configure how to react to a contract violation, i.e. throwing an assertion error and stop the application
or just logging the contract violation and continue the execution of the application.
<LI>Possibility to debug contracts in your favorite IDE. 
<LI>Concurrency. 
<LI>Writing contract classes using your favourite IDE's code completion features.
<LI>Refactoring and other
<A href="http://www.andrena.de/leistungen/ase-agile-software-engineering" 
target=_blank>Agile Software Engineering (ASE)</A>
techniques necessary in Scrum development teams.
