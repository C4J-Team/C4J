<EM>Contracts for Java</EM> (C4J) is a <I>Contracts</I> (from Design by Contract, see <A 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract" target=_blank>Wikipedia 
DbC definition</A>) framework for Java 1.6 and later.
The primary goal for C4J is ease of use.
Contracts are about design and quality, aspects of programming that a lot programmers don't spend enough time and energy on.
<BR>
Therefore a Contracts framework must be simple and painless to use.
At the same time the framework must be powerful.
<BR>
C4J is simple <EM>and</EM> powerful.

We are not going to try to convince any readers that Contracts are indeed a very powerful design and quality assurance technique,
so if you are not already convinced of that, 
please follow the links above and you may be convinced to try this tool out!
These are our favorites though:<BR>
<LI><I>Contracts</I> consist of <I>preconditions</I> and <I>postconditions</I>, which are systematically defined method by method.
<LI>The <I>class invariant</I> ensures the <I>DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)</I> for contracts by defining all those assertions,
which must be fulfilled at any visible state of an object, only once.
<LI>Contracts can be linked to classes and interfaces.
<LI>Contracts are inherited by extending a class or by implementing an interface which is guarded by a contract.
<LI>To be able to define meaningful contracts
you are forced to split lengthy methods into small, well defined, methods with a single responsibility.
<LI>As your contracts are checked at runtime, your classes are validated against the <I>real</I> usage of your application, 
not against some test cases that may not even be real use cases. 
<LI>If you are dealing with legacy code that you are afraid of refactoring, 
<I>external</I> contracts are perfect to add to existing code with no risk involved. 
</LI>
